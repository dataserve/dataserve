Dataserve is a fast and consistent interface to your data layer. It can be run as a server (via the Redis protocol), interacting with multiple services, or included in a standard NodeJS project. If you decide to change your frontend to a different language, Dataserve can still be used so you do not need to write your model logic all over in a new language. If you decide to spawn off different servers to handle different types of requests, Dataserve can be run independently, serving your applications data consistently.

With caching built in, you can quickly setup apps for whatever the use case. Version 0.0.2 currently supports with in-memory caching only. Redis and Memcache will be supported shortly.
